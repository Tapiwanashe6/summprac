## 6. Local Development Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone [YOUR REPOSITORY URL HERE]
cd [YOUR REPOSITORY DIRECTORY NAME]
```

### Step 2: Open the Project

Since this is a front-end application, simply open `index.html` in a browser.

## 7. Deployment

### 7.1 Prerequisites

- Two web servers:
  - **Web-01** and **Web-02** (where nginx is installed, and I configured `/etc/nginx/sites_available/default`, this file is where I hosted my application. I placed all my files used to make the application, including HTML, CSS, and JS, inside `/var/www/html` so that they can be accessed by visiting the IP address).
  
- **Load balancer:**
  - Through **lb-01** (where haproxy is installed to distribute the requests across those two servers). This was done by configuring the haproxy config file (`/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`), so you can access it by linking to the IP address of `lb-01`.

### 7.2 Domain Name

- A domain was created using **DotTech domain** and linked to the IP address. Now, if you visit my domain, you will get the same result as visiting via the IP address.

### 7.3 SSL Certificate

- From **lb-01**, I created a certificate using **certbot**, issued by **Letsencrypt** and signed by it, ensuring the connection is secure.

## 8. Challenges and Solutions

### API Rate Limiting

- **Issue:** Free-tier API plans have rate limits.
- **Solution:** Implemented local caching and optimized API requests.
